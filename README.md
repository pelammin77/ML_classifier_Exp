### I learn and test several machine learning classifier algorithms
1. Linear linear regression: Testing SkLearn algorithm and mde my own algoritm

2. Use/test SkLearn's K Nearest Neighbors Train model with data. Test model and made prediction.
* Using 'Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)' dataset. From University of California (UCL)

3. Made own K Nearest Neighbors algorithm
* Calculate Euclidean distance
